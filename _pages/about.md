# About Me

<img src="{{ "/assets/images/tsavoo.jpg" | absolute_url }}"
width="50%" hspace="20" align="right">

I am an aspiring multi-industry analyst, seeking to use proven business practices and data analytics skills to provide deep and actionable insights from any data set. Always searching for challenging opportunities to apply current expertise. I love working on projects, so feel free to reach out for collaboration.

My mother tongue is Python, but I also have experience working with dashboard /report skills using Excel, Python data visualization tools, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy and many other popular data analysis and machine learning libraries.

I have a bachelors degree in Physics from Kenyatta University, where I did
[my thesis][2] on measurement of quantum entanglement in optical systems. After
spending some time pursuing other interests,[^fnote2] I began working on my
Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at University of Colorado. My dissertation covers a
range of topics in statistics, data analytics, and understanding noisy
systems. For more details on all that, check out [my portfolio](/portfolio/), or
take a look at [my resume][4].

I currently live in San Francisco, where I work as a data scientist with the
inventory optimization team at [Stitch Fix][7].

[^fnote2]: After graduating from Reed, I spent some time living at
	[Great Vow Zen Monastery][3], where we followed a daily schedule of work and
	meditation.
