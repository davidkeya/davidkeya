Hi, my name is David I am an aspiring multi-industry data analyst, seeking to use proven business practices and data analytics skills to provide deep and actionable insights from any data set. Always searching for challenging opportunities to apply current expertise. I love working on projects, so feel free to reach out for collaboration.

My mother tongue is Python, but I also have experience working with dashboard /report skills using Excel, data visualization tools, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy and many other popular data analysis and machine learning libraries.

I have a bachelors degree in Mathematics and Physics from Kenyatta University, and a certification in Data analytics from General Assembly. My quantitative background enabled me to smoothly transition into the field of data analytics, where I have passionately used my skills to positively influence business decisions.

My project portfolio covers a range of areas in data analytics, including working with raw, messy data. For more details on all that, check out [my portfolio](/portfolio/), or

I currently live in Long Beach CA, where I work as a Data Specialist in the automotive industry.
